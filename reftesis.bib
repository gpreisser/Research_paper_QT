  abstract={A dissipating system consisting of two strongly interacting subsystems, each coupled to its respective thermal reservoir is considered. The usual method for obtaining a master equation for the reduced density operator of such a system is to assume the factorization of this density operator in the derivation of the irreversible term, retaining the coupling in the reversible term alone. This approach has the serious limitation that it fails to preserve detailed balance in general and yields an incorrect canonical form for the stationary solution of the density operator. A general approach, based on the introduction of a new interaction picture, is presented. This method is illustrated by applying it to a coupled boson system and to a two-level atom interacting with a single mode of the electromagnetic field.}

They show that a novel symmetry breaking transition occurs as the strength of the driving field is increased. Although the driving field, the cavity mode, and the atom are all resonant, above the transition threshold the intracavity field shows a bimodality in phase. The bimodality results from an intensity-dependent detuning between the driving field and the transition frequencies of the composite atom-cavity-mode 'molecule.' Well above the transition threshold the driven cavity mode plus atom behaves as a driven harmonic oscillator with randomly switched detuning; the detuning (and hence the phase of the interactivity field) changes sign each time the atom makes a spontaneous transition between dressed states.}

abstract = {We present a wave-function approach to the study of the evolution of a small system when it is coupled to a large reservoir. Fluctuations and dissipation originate in this approach from quantum jumps that occur randomly during the time evolution of the system. This approach can be applied to a wide class of relaxation operators in the Markovian regime, and it is equivalent to the standard master-equation approach. For systems with a number of states N much larger than unity this Monte Carlo wave-function approach can be less expensive in terms of calculation time than the master-equation treatment. Indeed, a wave function involves only N components, whereas a density matrix is described by N2 terms. We evaluate the gain in computing time that may be expected from such a formalism, and we discuss its applicability to several examples, with particular emphasis on a quantum description of laser cooling.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that the time evolution of an atom submitted to coherent laser fields and to dissipative processes, such as spontaneous emission of photons or excitation by a broadband incoherent field, can be considered to consist of a sequence of coherent evolution periods separated by quantum jumps occurring at random times. A general statistical analysis of this random sequence is presented for the case in which the number of relevant atomic states is finite and the delay functions giving the distribution of the time intervals between two successive jumps can easily be calculated. These general considerations are then applied to a simple model recently proposed for demonstrating the possibility of amplification without inversion of populations. We show how the quantum-jump approach allows one to calculate the respective contributions of the various physical processes responsible for the amplification or the attenuation of the probe field and to get new insights into the relevant physical mechanisms.},

Cavity QED is a field which undeniably traces its origins to Einstein's seminal work on the statistical theory of light and the nature of its quantized interaction with matter. In this paper, we emphasize the development of techniques for the confinement of atoms strongly coupled to high-finesse resonators and the experiments which these techniques enable.}
